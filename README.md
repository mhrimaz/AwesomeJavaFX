## Talks
*Interesting talks in conferences like JavaOne, Devoxx and others*
- [Creating Amazing Visualization Tools With JavaFX 8 (3D)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk-YfIdH0_Y) - By [Michael Hoffer](https://twitter.com/mihosoft)<br/>
Screencast that covers most topics from JavaOne 2013 Tutorial TUT6705: http://mihosoft.eu/?p=928<br/>
JavaFX is a powerful rich-client platform that is ideal for complex visualizations. In this tutorial, you will learn how to create amazing 2-D and 3-D visualization tools such as an interactive function plotter with Java 8 and JavaFX 8. For 2-D plotting, you will learn how to use the powerful charting API that comes with JavaFX. In addition, you will find out how to load 3-D geometries from text files (and a subset of .obj), render movies from JavaFX 3D via its snapshot functionality, and use the ray picking API for retrieving detailed information on parts of 3-D visualizations. To create nice-looking applications, the tutorial utilizes open source controls from the JFXtras project (jfxtras.org).
- [DataFX: The Best Way to Get Real-World Data into Your JavaFX Application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN4fo6x0DcQ) - by [Hendrik Ebbers](https://twitter.com/hendrikEbbers) and [Johan Vos](https://twitter.com/johanvos)<br/> The real value in most client-oriented business applications is the data sitting on remote servers and cloud systems. Unfortunately, retrieving and displaying this data is an exercise left to the developer, and it must be done (correctly!) before end users can interact with it. Fortunately, the open source DataFX framework aims to simplify this by enabling JavaFX developers to easily retrieve data from a variety of sources in several formats and rapidly integrate it with JavaFX components (such as TableView), using typical JavaFX patterns. This session introduces the free and open source DataFX project, gives practical advice for using it, and provides insight into future plans for this project.
- [DataFX: From External Data to a UI Flow and Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q65436KIuJ0) - by [Hendrik Ebbers](https://twitter.com/hendrikEbbers) and [Johan Vos](https://twitter.com/johanvos)<br/>The open source project DataFX 8 builds on the core principle of DataFX 2: make it easy for JavaFX developers to retrieve external data (using REST calls, database systems, or custom methods) and visualize this data in JavaFX controls. Using DataFX, you can populate UI controls by using the most-common protocols, including REST, SSE, or WebSocket. Apart from retrieving data, the Flow component in DataFX enables developers to describe different flows between UI components and to inject data models into the flows. This session shows how the different DataFX components make it easy to manage external data by using well-known Java technologies.
- [Enterprise JavaFX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yk6d8vjNE4) - by [Hendrik Ebbers](https://twitter.com/hendrikEbbers)<br/> The talks shows several APIs and technologies that usefull to create JavaFX applications that communicate with a server
- [Java on Mobile is a thing... and it's really good!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUMcWxvamWs) - by [Johan Vos](https://twitter.com/johanvos)<br/>
In this session, we show how to use your favourite IDE to write a Java Client application, and how to use that same IDE to create native applications that can be uploaded to the different appstores. These native applications use exactly the same code as a Java desktop application.
We talk about the status of JavaFX on Mobile, and about the options for running Java code on mobile devices (e.g. Dalvik/ART, RoboVM AOT, OpenJDK with the Mobile OpenJDK project).
- [Let’s Get Wet! AquaFX and Best Practices for Skinning JavaFX Controls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucvdYGLWLT0) - by [Hendrik Ebbers](https://twitter.com/hendrikEbbers) and [Claudine Zillmann](https://twitter.com/etteClaudette)<br/>  JavaFX offers a wide range of default controls for creating cool and great applications, from business to entertainment use cases. Because JavaFX is a multiplatform UI framework that can be used mainly on desktop-based platforms and embedded devices, a cross-platform skin named Caspian is provided by JavaFX. As of Java 8, Modena will be a official second cross-platform skin for JavaFX, but some applications and developers have a definite need for native or custom skins for their controls and applications. This session points out how to create custom skins for JavaFX controls. You will learn that with AquaFX, this custom skin can even feel like a native one.
- [Test-Driven Development with JavaFX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaB0t8NP3Oc&t=1479s) - by [Hendrik Ebbers](https://twitter.com/hendrikEbbers) and [Sven Ruppert](https://twitter.com/SvenRuppert)<br/> This session presents existing testing tools and frameworks in their current stage of development. It compares the capabilities and the kinds of impacts of existing projects. The presentation pays particular attention to questions such as How can a cross-platform GUI test be created?’With many legacy (Java Swing–based) applications in need of migrating to the new JavaFX 8 platform, it is imperative for GUI code to be testable. The industry needs better strategies and tools for efficient migration from Swing to JavaFX 8.
- [The JavaFX Community and Ecosystem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVIKZyqpnMY) - by [Hendrik Ebbers](https://twitter.com/hendrikEbbers) and Alexander Casall<br/> Do you want to start working with JavaFX but don’t know where you can find all the cool tutorials and open source APIs? This session is the perfect place to be! Leading up to the Java 8 release, a huge ecosystem with a lot of good tutorials and open source frameworks surrounds JavaFX. The community is getting bigger and bigger. The presentation introduces some of the most important parts of the JavaFX ecosystem such as third-party frameworks and popular knowledgebases and illustrates the functionality and synergy effects between the libraries with a live coding session. The session ends with real-world applications demonstrating the techniques and APIs discussed earlier.
