- [Creating Amazing Visualization Tools With JavaFX 8 (3D)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk-YfIdH0_Y) - By [Michael Hoffer](https://twitter.com/mihosoft)<br/>
Screencast that covers most topics from JavaOne 2013 Tutorial TUT6705: http://mihosoft.eu/?p=928<br/>
JavaFX is a powerful rich-client platform that is ideal for complex visualizations. In this tutorial, you will learn how to create amazing 2-D and 3-D visualization tools such as an interactive function plotter with Java 8 and JavaFX 8. For 2-D plotting, you will learn how to use the powerful charting API that comes with JavaFX. In addition, you will find out how to load 3-D geometries from text files (and a subset of .obj), render movies from JavaFX 3D via its snapshot functionality, and use the ray picking API for retrieving detailed information on parts of 3-D visualizations. To create nice-looking applications, the tutorial utilizes open source controls from the JFXtras project (jfxtras.org).
